This is a fun bot that entails generic commands. However, this bot also entails a specific lore. The lore has to do with a fun fictional character named Owl. The user is essentially using clues from this bot to peak an interest in order to find this character, and "free" the Owl from its cage. The bot will lead the user through two servers, where in the final server, if the user has a specific role, they will be able to use the command $release, as a means to free the Owl from the cage. Hence "winning" the game.

Commands are: 

$rebirth: Disguise everyones nickname with Egyptian hieroglyphics [ anti-raid purpose]
$disguise: Disguise the server channels with Egyptian hieroglyphics [ anti-raid purpose]
$reborn: Reset all channels back to initial names. 
$kemet: Disguise your nickname to an Egyptian hieroglyphic equivalent 
$cune: Disguise to cuneiform nickname
$nick: Reset name back to normal 
$rich: If baring the role 'sultan' , you will be given an abundance of never-ending wealth

$Legend: Access to the Server/Bot Lore
$KemetCode: Access to the secret servers to 'find' the Owl, if baring the 'chosen' role
'ð“…“': A taboo hieroglyphic which will automatically boot the user out of the server.[ Simulating a booby-trap]
